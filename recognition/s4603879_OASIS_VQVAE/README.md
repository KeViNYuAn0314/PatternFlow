# Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders

## Overview
This repository is used to implement the vq-vae project of COMP3710, where a variational autoencoder was built with vector quantized layer, and it takes OASIS brain images as input and reproduces reasonable images. The model is implemented based on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937) and referenced to the [code](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/examples/generative/vq_vae.py).
